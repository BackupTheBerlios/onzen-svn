Onzen

Onzen is a graphical front end for the revision control systems CVS,
SVN, and HG. It represent the files managed by the RCS in a tree-view
with detailed information and offers functions to e. g. update,
commit, add, remove, rename, revert, diff, view files and others.

Note:

Onzen has a long history. The first (never published) version was
written in TclTk and I used it for many years for my daily work. Now
Onzen is reimplemented from scratch in Java SWT.
